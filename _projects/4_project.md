**Platform:** Dexmate  
**Simulation:** Isaac Lab (NVIDIA)  
**Algorithm:** PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)  
**Status:** In progress — training ongoing, no real-robot deployment yet

### Overview

Training a Dexmate arm to juggle using reinforcement learning in Isaac Lab. Unlike the quasi-static pick-and-place tasks in the [manipulation project](/projects/3_project/), juggling requires continuous, highly dynamic control — catching and re-throwing an object under tight timing constraints — making it a good testbed for agile, high-frequency manipulation policies.
